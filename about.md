Nowadays you can find just about any information online. I am grateful that I am studying in an era where I can look up for concepts or methods of any kind, and somehow I will be able to get an answer. **Google, Stackoverflow, Youtube** and so on have been great teachers for me. I can definitely say that I have learned as much information from web as I have learned in college.
I believe this is due to all the contributions that other scientists, developers, and engineers make, sharing their thoughts and ideas in the easiest possible way for one to understand. As an **biomedical engineer** myself, I will be running this blog so that I can provide useful information about numerous subjects ranging from mathematics, engineering fundamentals, deep learning, biology and much more.
Posts will be updated twice a month to ensure high quality. Feel free to contact me if you have any questions :)
